Overall movie similarity consists of 3 factors with their multipliers representing the importance of each feature.
Each factor is a value between (0 - 1) * MULTIPLIER.
Multiplier values:
- genres: 6 - most important
- release year: 3
- budget: 2

Final formula:
overallSimilarity = genresSimilarity * GENRES_MULTI + yearSimilarity * YEAR_MULTI + budgetSimilarity * BUDGET_MULTI

* budgetSimilarity is only taken into account if both films have budget fields populated, otherwise it's 0.
