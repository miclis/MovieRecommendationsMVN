Two distinct users are compared based on movies they have both watched.
The difference in their ratings is calculated, summed up and divided by the number of movies that they have both watched.
This way an average difference per movie is calculated for a user pair.

The value is then normalized (divided by MAX_DIFFERENCE = 5) and substracted from 1.

The similarity value is always a number between 0 and 1; 1 - meaning exact same and 0 means totally different taste.
